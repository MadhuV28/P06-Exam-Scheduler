# P06-Exam-Scheduler
Whether you like them or not, evening exams are a reality of the UW-Madison student experience. As
you may have noticed, they’re rarely held in the same room as the lecture - scheduling exams is a whole
different problem for the administration. I’m not sure if they still do it by hand and call it an art form or
whether they’ve got it automated at least a little, but in this assignment we’re going to explore a design
for recursively matching courses needing exam rooms with available rooms.
In this program, you will create four classes:
● Course, a container for course-related information
● Room, a container for room-related information
● Schedule, an object to maintain the current draft schedule
● ExamScheduler, a collection of static recursive utility methods to help create the Schedule
The goals of this assignment are:
● Reinforcing object-oriented design and encapsulation of data and related methods
● Exploring recursive thinking and problem decomposition
● Additional practice designing tester methods and scenarios
The source code can be found in the 'P06/src' directory.
